## ðŸŒ± About Me

I am a biomedical researcher who loves to take on new challenges. I would love to gain knowledge about informatics in order to apply it to my current work: research related to human pathologies and inflammation. I'm going for it!

## ðŸš€ My Projects

- **Project A**: My first project is my own training. I am a student of 42 and I am on the way to learn programming. For that reason, I have few projects developed.
- **Project B**: Secondly, I have developed a set of projects for 1 month, framed in a selection process to become a student of 42 (Piscine).
- **Project C**: Once the pool was finished, I was selected to be part of 42 Madrid, where I am currently a student. This is my main project now, swimming and swimming to learn and interact with fellow programmers as much as possible.

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- Programming Languages:
     * Currently: C, R.
     * Future: Python, C++ and Java.
